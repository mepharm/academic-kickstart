**<h3>RAW MATERIALS</h3>**
<p>Once raw materials are manufactured or received at M.E. Pharmaceuticals they are held in a quarantine area for analysis. Samples from quarantined raw materials are analyzed in our in-house laboratories to verify all materials that enter the facility. We utilize validated FDA and International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) methods for analysis. After validation is complete the materials are released for production.</p>

**<h3>FORMULATION</h3>**
<p>M.E. Pharmaceuticals industrial and physical pharmacy experts provide specialized formulations to our customers. Development begins with identifying the appropriate formulation and source selection, followed by necessary analysis and validation methods. Development of custom formulation requires specific knowledge of each component used to make the final product including:

Physical and chemical characterization
Stability assays
Identification of manufacturing process
Scale-up for commercial manufacturing
Process validation.</p>

**<h3>IN-PROCESS</h3>**
<p>The manufacturing process is continuously monitored by M.E. Pharmaceuticals Quality Assurance professionals to ensure that current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) are adhered to throughout the entire process.</p>

**<h3>FINISHED PRODUCT</h3>**
<p>The chemical properties as well as the aesthetics of the final product are analyzed before being released for packaging. These products are then packaged in one of the many packaging options available at M.E. Pharmaceuticals, including child-resistant and tamper-resistant options. Packaged products undergo a final inspection before being released for shipping.</p>

**<h3>POST-PRODUCTION</h3>**
<p>Production areas at M.E. Pharmaceuticals were specially designed for efficient changeover. The proper changeover and maintenance of equipment prevents contamination and increases efficiency. We adhere to stringent disposal techniques to prevent contamination and ensure environmental safety.


From raw material to end product, all materials are identified with a distinct lot number for simple and reliable traceability.</p>
